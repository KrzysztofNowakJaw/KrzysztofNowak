I've worked with many tools over the course of my several-year career, but two have made a particular mark on my professional experience and education: Alteryx and the R language.

::: {#Alteryx .panel-tabset .nav-pills}
## Alteryx

Alteryx is low code platform designed to perform ETL process

## R

R is programming languages designed for statistics and graphics.

However, it has evolved considerably in recent years, mainly due to the Tidyverse ecosystem which also makes it a powerful tool in the area of Business Intelligence or Data Engineering.
